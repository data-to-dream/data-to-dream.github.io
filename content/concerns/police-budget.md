title: 'Police Budget'
---

# Overview

Police are the largest expense in the operating budgets for the City of Houston and Harris County. Due to the stateâ€™s anti-defund law, local governments face severe restrictions in reducing police spending. The median overall pay for the Houston Police Department during the 2022-2023 fiscal year was [$97,792](https://www.houstonchronicle.com/projects/2024/houston-city-salary-database/), higher than any other city department.
